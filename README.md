# bondora-financial-analysis
In this project we will be doing credit risk modelling of peer to peer lending Bondora systems.Data for the study has been retrieved from a publicly available data set of a leading European P2P lending platform (Bondora).The retrieved data is a pool of both defaulted and non-defaulted loans from the time period between 1st March 2009 and 27th January 2020. The data comprises of demographic and financial information of borrowers, and loan transactions.In P2P lending, loans are typically uncollateralized and lenders seek higher returns as a compensation for the financial risk they take. In addition, they need to make decisions under information asymmetry that works in favor of the borrowers. In order to make rational decisions, lenders want to minimize the risk of default of each lending decision, and realize the return that compensates for the risk.
In this notebook we will preprocess the raw dataset and will create new preprocessed csv that can be used for building credit risk models.Please review this link for better understanding of the project:https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18K2eAhlUYhJ2R_dPbv34tEmvr36ubSF7?usp=sharing
